# Criteria A- Planning

## Definition of the problem
The client is climbing club leader Sara Goh. Sara would like to be able to take attendance faster, and keep track of her inventory of climbing equipment, and have that information stored in an easily accesible place. Using google sheets to take attendance and stock means that she has to go in and edit things column by column, which takes time and can be confusing, especially for week by week attendance.
