# Criteria A- Planning

## Definition of the problem
The client is climbing club leader Sara Goh. Sara would like to be able to take attendance faster, and keep track of her inventory of climbing equipment, and have that information stored in an easily accesible place. Using google sheets to take attendance and stock means that she has to go in and edit things column by column, which takes time and can be confusing, especially for week by week attendance.


## Solution to problem
Develop a website for client that will fufill multiple purposes. The website has a quiclink to a google forumn that can take attendance on the given day, attendance will be stored in a database organized by date and member. At any time the database can be accessed through the website, and be edited. A similar database will be created for gym equipment, possibly budget. The website should be an easy to navigate central hub of information for the client to keep track of the club. 


## Success Criteria
1.) The website features can only be accessed by client, login/user feature
2.) User data- login and password should be secured.
3.) The website should be self-explanatory for the most-part, user should be able to navigate it quickly and easily.
4.) The website has a link to record attendance on any given day, the members of the club will be logged so that they may be selected.
5.)The website stores all attendance on a database. 
6.)All climbing equipment will also be stored on a seperate database
7.)Both databases have edit and search functions.
