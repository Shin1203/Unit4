# Criteria A- Planning

## Definition of the problem
The clients are gym club leadaers Yu Ueno and Filip Ignoineigk. They would like a general app/website for both gym club leaders and members. The app/website should be able to be quickly accessed to take attendance. Attendance should be stored in a database which should be easy to read and navigate. Perhaps the attendance wil be kept using a google forms page. Keeping track of budget usage and money spent per gym session. Members should be able to access it to get an idea for what gym club is, and also get information on how to join, about kazakoshi park, what to bring, and other useful information. Perhaps include self-tracking or other features. The idea is for the website/app to be simplistic in design and be accesible to everyone.
