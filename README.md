# Criteria A- Planning

## Definition of the problem
The client is climbing club leader Sara Goh. Sara would like to be able to take attendance faster, and keep track of her inventory of climbing equipment, and have that information stored in an easily accesible place. Using google sheets to take attendance and stock means that she has to go in and edit things column by column, which takes time and can be confusing, especially for week by week attendance.


## Solution to problem
Develop a website for client that will fufill multiple purposes. The website has a form functionality that can take attendance on the given day, attendance will be stored in a database organized by date and member. At any time the database can be accessed through the website, and be edited. A similar database will be created for gym equipment, possibly budget. The website should be an easy to navigate central hub of information for the client to keep track of the club. 

## Solution justification
-Website was chosen as it will be easy to access- There is no installation process like with applications, and can be accessed on both computer and phone.
-Login/security functionality is there so that only the client can edit the club attendance, and nobody can come in and alter it.
-For taking attendance, using a form built on the website is much quicker than going into the databse and editing elements individually.
-The database is useful as it sorts the information taken from all the attendance forms, and so information can be quickly interpreted from it.
-Editing of the equipment database will be direct, as additions and changes won't have to be made as frequently as attendance.
-As a whole, the website will centralize all information on climbing club, making everything easier to organize and find. It wil also make recording attendance and editing equipment inventory much easier, satisfying the needs that arise from the client's problem.


## Success Criteria
1.) The website features can only be accessed by client, login/user feature

2.) User data- login and password should be secured.

3.) The website should be self-explanatory for the most-part, user should be able to navigate it quickly and easily.

4.) The website has a form to record attendance on any given day, the members of the club will be logged so that they may be selected.

5.)The website stores all attendance on a database. 

6.)All climbing equipment will also be stored on a seperate database

7.)Both databases have edit and search functions.

8.)The website is usable on both phone and computer
